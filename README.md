## Course Evaluation
I am proud to share that I received an average rating of 5/5 in the course evaluation. This reflects my dedication, hard work, and strong understanding of the course material.

I have generalized the content and omitted specific details such as the course code and name to maintain confidentiality and respect the educational institution's guidelines regarding sharing course materials. By doing so, I ensure that the repository remains discreet while still showcasing my skills and expertise in machine learning. However, feel free to explore the notebooks in this repository to get insights into my learning journey and the projects I completed during the course.

If you have any questions or would like to connect with me, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting my repository!
